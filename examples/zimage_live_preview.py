"""Live-preview a Z-Image-Turbo generation with mlx-taef.

Run: uv run python examples/zimage_live_preview.py

Writes a low-quality TAEF1 preview every denoise step while mflux generates,
plus the final mflux-generated image as ``preview_final.webp``. Z-Image reuses
TAEF1's weights, so the preview model is a few MB and decodes in milliseconds.

Z-Image-Turbo is a distilled model (``supports_guidance=False``). mflux forces
``guidance=0.0`` and uses the ``linear`` scheduler — passing any other guidance
value has no effect.
